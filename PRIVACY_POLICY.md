This Privacy Policy explains how the application **GooD Autobackuper** ("the Application") accesses, uses, and stores your data.

## 1. Data Collection

The Application requires access to your Google Drive account in order to perform automated file backups. To do this, it uses OAuth 2.0 authentication and stores the following files **locally on your device**:
- `credentials.json` — for developer authentication;
- `token.json` — stores the user's access and refresh tokens;
- `rules.csv` — stores your personal backup rules.

The Application does **not** collect, store, or transmit your data to any third parties or external servers.

## 2. Use of Information

The information obtained is used solely to:
- Authenticate your Google Drive session;
- Execute backup rules defined by you;
- Perform file uploads to the Google Drive folders you specify.

## 3. Data Storage

All data is stored **locally** on your machine. The Application does **not** send data over the internet other than to the official Google Drive API, as required for functionality.

## 4. Third Parties

The Application does **not** share your information with any third parties.

## 5. User Responsibility

You are responsible for managing your own Google Cloud project and credentials. The Application only operates within the scope you authorize.

## 6. Contact
